Total Time 
Create an object, serialize it to a byte array, then deserialize it back to an object.

Serialization Time 
Create an object, serialize it to a byte array. * Java's built-in serializer faithfully represents arbitrary object graphs, which hurts performance.

Deserialization Time 
Often the most expensive operation. To make a fair comparison, all fields of the deserialized instances are accessed - this forces lazy deserializers to really do their work. The raw data below shows additional measurements for deserialization.
